Welcome to my very own markdown page!

## What will this page be used for?

* Posting Labs
* Creating a professional webpage to showcase my work in this class
* Whatever else there is to do

## Test of markdown features

1. Blockquotes

   > "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents" 
   > *-MarkDown Guide*

2. Links and Italics

3. Horizontal Rule

4. Bold

   **MarkDown** is a very funny name because it is the opposite of **markup**! Ha Ha Ha Ha!

5. Images

6. Inline Code

   Our inline code will look like this: `System.out.println("Pretty awesome!");`

7. To add a code block:

   ```
   String message = "MarkDown is on top of MarkUp!";
   System.out.println(message);
   ```
